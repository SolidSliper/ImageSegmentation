The aim of the bachelor thesis is to desegment parts of image data based on segmentation algorithms from discrete mathematics theory. The data comes from biology and medicine, in which the elements of iron Fe and nickel Ni are present. The goal will be to study the segmentation algorithms, build a working computer program/application, and desegment the desired objects.
Later on: presentation of program
